/**
 *  @brief      Limits the memory that can be allocated from another Arena.
 *
 *  @details    Class LimitedArena constrains the amount of memory that can be
 *              requested of its parent by maintaining a count of the bytes it
 *              has allocated so far and by throwing an exception if the count
 *              ever exceeds a certain preset limit.
 *
 *              The limit is specified at construction using the 'limit' field
 *              of the options structure. For example:
 *  @code
 *                  b = newArena(Options("B").limit(1*GB).parent(a));
 *  @endcode
 *              creates a new Arena 'b' that is permitted to allocate as much
 *              as a gibibyte of memory from the Arena 'a' before throwing an
 *              arena::Exhausted exception. Clients can track the memory that
 *              is still available by calling available(), and can also catch
 *              the exception if they attempt to allocate beyond this limit.
 *
 *              Bear in mind that other arenas may also be allocating from the
 *              the same parent too:  the limit affects only those allocations
 *              made through *this* Arena,  while others,  perhaps with larger
 *              internal limits, may satisfy requests where this one fails to.
 *              The parent, of course, may also carry a limit of its own too.
 *
 *              Thus the arenas form a sort of tree,  with requests for memory
 *              flowing in at the leaves, propagating their way up towards the
 *              root, and being checked and monitored all along their journey.
 *
 *  @see        Class Exhausted for more on recovering from an out-of-memory
 *              exception.
