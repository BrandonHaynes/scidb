SSDB benchmark:
--------------
You can run the SSDB benchmark using the run_{LVL}.sh scripts.
where LVL is the dificulty level (tiny, very_small, small, normal) 

The scripts are executed using (example tiny config):
./run_tiny.sh [-g|-i|-h]

Where:

g	Causes the data generation and also the init phase.
i	Creates the arrays, load the data from ./data, and prepares the different data structures.
h	Prints this message
No parameter Only Execute the benchmark given all the data is loaded/prepared.

Parallel Configuration:
-----------------------
To allow a faster load with multiple node, data must be generated into each node. We provide the some
utilities to perform this task. Note: You must modify the scripts given your case.
Example:
- Each datafile must reside on the same path under each node, this path should already exist, ex: /data/normal 
- Copy ssdbgen, tileData and chunkDistributer.sh under /data/normal for all the nodes (see: setenv.sh)
- Execute parallelChunkCreation.sh from the master node.
- Execute ./run_normal.sh -i
