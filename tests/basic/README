README

Here we have a very basic testing framework which will be replaced by something better later (however the tests will stay)

  run.py - this is the test script, takes the connect string as an argument
    This script will run all the create queries, then all the load queries, and then all queries in the remaning subdirectories (except for data).

    The output of each "xxx.aql" file is written in "xxx.aql.tmp" file and later diffed against "xxx.aql.res" file
    Hence to add a test, you need to create the "xxx.aql" file in the folder of your choice, run the script, 
    check "aql.tmp" result, and if its correct, move it to "xxx.aql.res" and commit both files.
    All queries also generate a "xxx.aql.stderr" file that can be used to check exceptions. If the query doesn't produce a
    result, its output is checked against the run.xxx.aql.err file to check the error message
