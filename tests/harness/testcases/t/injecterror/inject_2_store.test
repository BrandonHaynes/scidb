# injectError (nodeid, errorid)
# Error_IDs for inject error:
# 1 - a specific error injected into the Storage::writeChunk code path which is triggered at the end of writing the first chunk
# 2 - a specific error injected into the ReplicationManager::sendItem code path which is triggered when the ReplicationManager is trying to send a chunk to a remote node
# 3 - a specific error injected into the ReplicationManager::wait code path which is triggered when the ReplicationManager is trying to wait until more buffer/queue space is available in NetworkManager. This path is often taken when replication network flow control is pushing back. 
# 4 - a generic error to be interpreted by a specific operator. store(),redim_store(),sg(),rename() error out after they have done 99% of the work (99% because a coordinator will error out before creating a new version in the catalog). remove() errors out before it does any work.
