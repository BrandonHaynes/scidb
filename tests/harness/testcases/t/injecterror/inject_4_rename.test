# NOTE: This test assumes you are running with the default four SciDB
#       instances.

# injectError (nodeid, errorid)
# Error_IDs for inject error:
# 1 - a specific error injected into the Storage::writeChunk code path which is
#     triggered at the end of writing the first chunk
# 2 - a specific error injected into the ReplicationManager::sendItem code
#     path which is triggered when the ReplicationManager is trying to send
#     a chunk to a remote node
# 3 - a specific error injected into the ReplicationManager::wait code path
#     which is triggered when the ReplicationManager is trying to wait until
#     more buffer/queue space is available in NetworkManager. This path is
#     often taken when replication network flow control is pushing back.
# 4 - a generic error to be interpreted by a specific operator.
#     store(),redim_store(),sg(),rename() error out after they have done 99%
#     of the work (99% because a coordinator will error out before creating
#     a new version in the catalog). remove() errors out before it does any work.
