# ticket 4346
# when the local width * height of a matrix exceeded 2^31,
# the multiplication of two 32-bit numbers at reformat.cpp line 236.
# one of the multiplicands should have been increased to 64-bit before
# the multiply to avoid overflow.
# in GEMMPhysical.cpp (matrixLocalSize) wrapped negative before
# The following reproduced the bug:

create array smSquare<a: double>     [r=0:1000-1, 1000,0, c=0:1000-1,      1000,0]
create array wideLarge<a: double >   [r=0:1000-1 ,1000,0, c=0:2147484,     1000,0]
create array tallLarge<a: double >   [r=0:2147484,1000,0, c=0:1000-1,      1000,0]

# note, missing cells will be treated as 0, so don't build the matrices
# that will be very slow due to their size
