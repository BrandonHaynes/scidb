SCIDB QUERY : <csv2scidb -h>
csv2scidb: Convert CSV file to SciDB input text format.
Usage:   csv2scidb [options] [ < input-file ] [ > output-file ]
Default: -f 0 -c 1000000 -q
Options:
  -v        version information
  -i PATH   input file
  -o PATH   output file
  -a PATH   appended output file
  -c INT    length of chunk
  -f INT    starting coordinate
  -n INT    number of instances
  -d CHAR   delimiter: defaults to ,
  -p STR    type pattern: N number, S string, s nullable-string,
            C char, c nullable-char
  -q        quote the input line exactly by wrapping it in ()
  -s N      skip N lines at the beginning of the file
  -h        prints this helpful message

Note: the -q and -p options are mutually exclusive.
