# remark: possible to use a method more like that of the centos6() function above? i dislike the current approach because
# it hard codes knowledge of specific 3rd party deps (mpich2 and libboost). Perhaps set up a Local Repository and then use
# apt-get install as usual? Also, investigate use of dpkg-scanpackages, which may prove helpful. jab 8/2013. See #3506
