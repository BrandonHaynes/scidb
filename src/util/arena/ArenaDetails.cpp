/**
 *  Return the current arena associated with the current thread of execution.
 *
 *  An Allocator, like the managed containers that use it,  can be constructed
 *  by explicitly supplying the arena from which it is to allocate from. There
 *  are a number of situations that arise, however, in which it is awkward, or
 *  even impossible, to do so. Consider, for example, an array of vectors:
 *
 *  @code
 *      ArenaPtr              a = ...                    // Abstract arena
 *      managed::vector<int>  v[...];                    // Array of vectors
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  For any type to serve as the element type of an array, it must be possible
 *  to construct its objects *without arguments*; the language simply does not
 *  provide the necessary syntax to indicate that the arena 'a' should be used
 *  to construct each element of 'v'.  What we appear to be bumping up against
 *  is the fact that the standard library was designed with incomplete support
 *  for what are now known as 'stateful allocators'.
 *
 *  The C++11 language improves this situation by adding the necessary support
 *  for stateful allocators,  introducing the concept of a 'scoped' allocator,
 *  providing the 'scoped_allocator_adaptor' template class, and by revisiting
 *  the design of each and every container class that carries an allocator. In
 *  particular, in C++11, containers can be made to propagate their allocators
 *  on down to their elements recursively.
 *
 *  In lieu of such complete language support, however, the current version of
 *  the arena library adopts a somewhat simpler approach to the problem:  each
 *  thread maintains a stack of arena pointers, and the default constructor of
 *  class Allocator is implemented to grab the top arena from this stack via a
 *  call to getArena().  The stack itself is manipulated by instances of class
 *  Scope, which push and pop the current thread's stack as they come into and
 *  go out of existence and thus synchronize the thread local arena stack with
 *  the lexical scope in which they are instantiated - hence the name.
 *
 *  Interestingly,  the Boost library appears to have an implementation of the
 *  standard container classes - the Boost Container library - that works with
 *  both stateful and scoped allocators: one that even compiles under C++98. A
 *  future version of the arena library  may wish to adopt this implementation
 *  instead as a step towards supporting compilation under C++11.
 *
 *  @see    http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html for a good introduction to
 *  scoped allocators.
 *
 *  @see    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/doc/html/container.html for
 *  more on the Boost Container library.
 *
 *  Update: In 13.9 we upgraded to version 1.54 of the Boost library, and also
 *  reimplemented the managed  containers to use the  Boost Container library.
 *  In order to facilitate conversion of exisiting code to use the new managed
 *  containers, however, there's still a need to support the idea of a default
 *  or 'current' arena, though it is not yet clear whether the model of a per-
 *  thread arena stack is the right one to adopt - it may well be more trouble
 *  than it is worth; in the mean time, and until we gain more experience with
 *  using the library, we prefer to simply return the root arena instead.
