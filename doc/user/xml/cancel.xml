    <para>Cancel a currently running query by query id.</para>

    <para>The query id can be obtained from the SciDB log or via the
    list('queries') command. SciDB maintains query context information for
    each completed and in-progress query in the server. If the user issues a
    "ctrl-C" or abort from the client, the query is cancelled and its context
    is removed from the server.</para>
