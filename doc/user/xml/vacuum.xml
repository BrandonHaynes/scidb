    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>The <literal>vacuum</literal> operator reclaims storage that is no
    longer used in your SciDB arrays. When you run vacuum, SciDB moves all
    free segments in the storage file (<emphasis
    role="bold">storage.data1</emphasis>, one file per instance) to the end of
    the file and then truncates them, reducing the size of the file, and
    returning the unused space to the operating system.</para>

    <para>While vacuum is running, all other read or write queries are made to
    wait until vacuum is finished. If vacuum is cancelled or there is a power
    outage during vacuum, the system remains in a fully-functional state; you
    can restart the vacuum process by calling the operator again. Vacuum
    returns an array that tells the user how much space was reclaimed on each
    instance.</para>
