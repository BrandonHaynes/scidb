# we'll need the transposed matrix (the "from vertex" is name of the columns) for the iterations
#
# MAT_IN given

#
# pagrank computation notes
# let H =$MAT_IN ... i.e. columns of H sum to 1 except where a page has
# no outgoing links (so the column is all 0)
# let S = H with the zero columns replaced by columns of u=1/n, ***
#  i.e. uniform probability of going to any page
# and to keep the "random surfer" from being trapped in a strongly connected component,
# then we add a damping factor alpha, and a constant matrix E with uniform probability of going anywhere
# i.e. full of the columns we added to H
# using these defintions, we can define the "google matrix", G:
# G = alpha S + (1-alpha)E
# G is suitable for applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem, by which we know a
# unique right eigenvector (called the perron vector, P) exists
# (that is, the solution of G*PI = PI corresponding to the largest eigenvalue)
# 
# Since the Perron-Frobenius theorem applies, we can use the power method to converge on this eigenvector
# compute Q_k+1 = G*Q_k ; Q_0 = t(1/n,1/n,...), or the uniform probability distribution across all vertices
#
# computing Q_k:
# H is sparse, and G is not, so we want to do the computation in terms of H in a way
# limiting any dense portion of the calculation to vectors, (or repeated use of a scalar where possible)
#     Q_k+1 = G Q_k
#           = [alpha S + (1-alpha)E ] Q_k
#           = [alpha (H+T) + (1-alpha)E ] Q_k   ; where T= uniform columns as in *** above
# however, note that the second term is a scalar, and the third term is a vector with identical entries
# therefore, these three terms can be reduced to a sparse vector Q_k+1 + one vector of C_k+1 = c*(1,1,1,1,...) for some scalar c
# Letting  Q_i = Q_i + C_i  and substituting for Q_k and Q_k+1 we get:
#     Q_k+1 + C_k+1 = alpha H (Q_k+C_k))+ alpha T (Q_k+C_k) + (1-alpha) E (Q_k+C_k)
# Rearranging to group the vectors and " vectors":
#     Q_k+1         = alpha H Q_k +       alpha (T (Q_k+C_k))where Q_0 + (1-alpha) E Q_k
#             C_k+1 = alpha H C_k +       alpha (T (Q_k+C_k))where !Q_0 + (1-alpha) E C_k
# Note that the c_k term cannot affect the relative order of the result, so does not need to be computed
# Therefore we don't need to compute the c_i portion at all, as it does not affect the relative rankings
# so we will just compute Q_i, and sort the vertices by that
# Note we could compute c_i with time proportional to the number of "zero columns" in MAT_IN' in each pass;
# however, matrices such as the twitter data have a very high number of zero columns, so it is wasteful
# to compute c_i
